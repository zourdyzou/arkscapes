## TODO: some of the things that needs to be working on.

- [ ] Add internationalization features (🌏 Third-party? or file-based?)
- [ ] Optimize bundling runtime, maybe Bun? (💡 Good-to-go but not important)
- [ ] SEO custom components, meta-data and json-ld (🧪 SEO optimization on google ranking)
- [ ] Image and Icon custom components that comply that WAI-ARIA convention
- [ ] Web Accessibility pre-caution for DX (🔰 Quite a feat)
